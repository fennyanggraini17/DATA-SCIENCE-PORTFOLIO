**DATA SCIENCE WITH RAPIDMINER**  
Welcome to my Data Science projects using RapidMiner! In this folder, youâ€™ll find a collection of simple yet insightful projects that demonstrate how to use RapidMiner for data analysis and machine learning.

RapidMiner is a user-friendly platform that allows data scientists to build powerful models through a visual interface. In this repository, Iâ€™ve included workflows that showcase basic tasks like data cleaning, feature selection, and model building using RapidMinerâ€™s drag-and-drop tools.

Though the projects are small, they demonstrate key techniques and workflows that are essential for data science, such as classification and regression models. These projects helped me learn how to handle data and build models effectively using RapidMiner.

Feel free to explore the workflows, and I hope they give you a good idea of how to approach data analysis and modeling with RapidMiner. Thanks for checking out my work! ðŸ˜Š
